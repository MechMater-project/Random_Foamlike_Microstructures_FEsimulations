# Random_Foamlike_Microstructures_FEsimulations
STL format and Abaqus mesh inp files for random porous microstructures like foams are distributed here.

The microstructures have been build by shrinking Voronoi volumes obtained from randomly distributed seed points in a unit cube.
Building procedure and example of results are given in:

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mechmat.2025.105566

The microstructures have been used for finite element simulations of severe compression with success.
The explicit Abaqus input files for uniaxial compression are also available. 

Please cite [1] and the github link if you use some of these files.
