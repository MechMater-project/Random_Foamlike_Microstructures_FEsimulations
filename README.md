# Random_Foamlike_Microstructures_FEsimulations
STL format or Abaqus mesh inp files for random porous microstructures like foams are distributed here.
The microstructures have been used for finite element simulations of severe compression with success.
They have been build using by shrinking Voronoï volumes obtained from randomly distributed seed points.
Building procedure and example of results are given in:

The explicit Abaqus input files for uniaxial compression are also available. 

Please cite [1] and the github link if you use some of these files.
